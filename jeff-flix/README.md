### Personal note:

#### Weekend 1: UI Design & MVP (Frontend Focus)
- Prototype a basic, responsive UI for video browsing, playback, and user controls.
- Use React/Vue for speed; aim for core features like search and play/resume.
- Milestone: Deploy a static MVP to localhost; test usability.

#### Weekend 2: Database & Authentication (Backend Setup)
- Model a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for watch history, resumes, and user data.
- Implement auth (e.g., JWT or OAuth) for secure access.
- Milestone: Integrate with Week 1 UI; seed test data and verify CRUD ops.

#### Weekend 3: Video Streaming & Conversion (Core Logic + "Cloud" Skills)
- Handle streaming for various formats (e.g., MP4, MKV) using libraries like FFmpeg or HLS.
- Spin up a node on gaming PC for batch video conversion/transcoding.
- Milestone: Stream a converted file end-to-end; optimize for bandwidth.

#### Weekend 4: TBD
- (Polish, integration, or stretch goals based on progress.)
